                    <p>Anyone who is reading this, just read it. I've only told two people whom I consider my closest forms of emotional support, so making myself transparent and honest means something to me. 
                    <br><br>
                    I'm not looking for arguments or debates. All I really want for you to do is understand my perspective on what I think happiness is, then maybe think to yourself about what happiness is.. Also forgive me for poor writing and structure, it's hard to organize all these thoughts.</p>

                    <p><b>Well... I think the picture above was the last time I was truly happy with my plans, my goals, my health, my mentality, my stability, my emotions, myself... my life.</b></p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Sadness</h2>

                    <p>I don't know why I'm sad. This started happening recently where I would wake up in the middle of the night after an extremely vivid dream. Most of these dreams is just me hurting, the pain is real and I wake up feeling lost. In these dreams I'm crying, I don't cry very often so I guess my subconcious is letting itself go in my dreams. Which is something I can appreciate so I don't break down in the middle of the day.</p>

                    <p>Well as of late, I've been trying to find what is causing this sadness. I want to find the source so I can address it, solve it, mitigate it, and ultimately get rid of it.</p>

                    <p><b><i>Maybe I'm sad because:</b></i> 
                        <br>
                        I have no special person to say good morning to.
                        <br>
                        I haven't been lifting regularly since school has been so busy.
                        <br>
                        I'm not really good at anything, just decent, or average at everything.
                        <br>
                        I'm not as smart as some of my classmates.
                        <br>
                        I'm not as athletic as some of the athletes I go to school with.
                        <br>
                        I'm not eating healthy and am letting myself deteriorate.
                        <br>
                        I lack motivation to get up, which is why I sleep in until 5PM on weekends.
                        <br>
                        I binge drink when I get the chance to.
                        <br>
                        I enjoy spending time alone so I don't rub off on other people.
                        <br>
                        I try not to perpetuate negativity but do so anyways.
                        <br>
                        I have no special person to say good night to.
                        <br><br>

                        Maybe I spend so much time trying to figure out what I'm sad about, that I dig myself a deeper hole by finding flaws in myself, the world, and others; all the while forgetting the beauty and goodness that exists.
                    </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Happiness</h2>
                    <blockquote>You can't be happy if you don't want or let yourself be happy. Likewise you can't love others when you can't love yourself.</blockquote>

                    <p>This is something I tell a lot of people that talk to me when they vent about a rut they're in, a relationship problem that they're trying to solve, a career obstacle they've encountered, or anything that will fade their smiles.</p>

                    <p>My version of pursuing happiness is being able to look forward to something positive, something that gets you going through your day, your week, your month, your year, and quite possibly your life. </p>

                    <p>This may explain why a lot of people try to find fulfillment in a variety of different things. Setting new goals, always wanting more, and ultimately never being content.</p>


                    <p>Well so what? What's the point of this blog post? There is no point, I don't know what the point of it is either. It's what I'm trying to figure out. I just want to do my best to sort out all the emotions that run through my head.</p>
