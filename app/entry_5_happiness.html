                    <p>Anyone who is reading this, just read it. I've only told two people whom I consider my closest forms of emotional support, so making myself transparent and honest means something to me. 
                    <br><br>
                    I'm not looking for arguments or debates. All I really want for you to do is understand my perspective on what I think happiness is, then maybe think to yourself about what happiness is.. Also forgive me for poor writing and structure, it's hard to organize all these thoughts.</p>

                    <p><b>Well... I think the picture above was the last time I was truly happy with my plans, my goals, my health, my mentality, my stability, my emotions, myself... my life.</b></p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Sadness</h2>

                    <p>That picture was from December of 2015 for reference. It was about the time where I thought I had myself figured out and I found a girl I truly finally loved. But this isn't about her, or me, it was just the fact that it was when I was happy. I didn't have much to complain about, conversatiosn with people were normal, not negative in nature and for the most part were light-hearted and fun. Several months down the line I'm faced with a dilemma that I won't explain, but I had to find an internship that was based in the Bay Area so I can stay with my friends, family, and above all else at the time, my girlfriend.</p>

                    <p>Rejection after rejection after rejection, running into seldom long distance relationship problems, and constantly questioning myself and who I was and needed to be in order to succeed, caused me to lose an identity. All this accumulation of school work, relationships, and stress piled on one another. In a sense I got so used to trying to please other people that in a sense I lost a bit of myself. I got so involved with how people actually functioned emotionally that I found all faults in those around me and especially myself. It led me to what I call an endless cycle of apathy and self-doubt.</p>

                    <p>I always asked myself why people act a certain way in certain situations and began to think about the big picture. But what is the big picture in anything? Is it wealth, is it fame, is it love, is it a career? What is the most common about every life however, is that it begins with a birth, and ends in a death. Within that death lies a memory of a person. For many however, it's oblivion. This when I started having strange subconscious thoughts, I began to lose emotion for a lot of things, I became less receptive, more bitter, more critical, and most importantly.. less happy. </p>

                    <p>When so much of my life is based upon the ability to take advantage of opportunities and when the people in charge of these opportunities can dictate my life trajectory, I naturally try to mold myself into the what others people want me to be but in many ways that only hurt me by not being able to be myself. But that's where I think the problem stems from... is I don't know who myself is and what I stand for. All my life I've let people's descriptions of me mold who I am and let myself become.</p>

                    <p>One strange night something in February or March, in my dream, a sequence of two events that both ended in death: falling straight from the top of a tall building and driving at high speeds into the center median or column. In both these instances within my dream I felt peace, happiness.. an escape via a quick, easy and achievable death. I knew this was wrong, I knew I would never resort to these things ever in reality. But why was it so comforting and why was I so happy to be perished into a memory? I don't know, and to this day I still don't know. </p>
                    
                    <p>I don't know why I'm sad. These very real dreams have resurfaced more recently when I would wake up in the middle of the night after an extremely vivid dream. Most of these dreams is just me hurting, I'm crying, kneeling, reaching for help but no one is there. The pain is real and I wake up feeling lost. My subconcious is letting itself go in my dreams. I've been trying to find what is causing this sadness. I want to find the source so I can address it, solve it, mitigate it, and ultimately get rid of it. But I can't</p>

                    <p><b><i>Maybe I'm sad because:</b></i> 
                        <br>
                        I have no special person to say good morning to.
                        <br>
                        I haven't been lifting regularly since school has been so busy.
                        <br>
                        I'm not really good at anything, just decent, or average at everything.
                        <br>
                        I'm not as smart as some of my classmates.
                        <br>
                        I'm not as athletic as some of the athletes I go to school with.
                        <br>
                        I'm not eating healthy and am letting myself deteriorate.
                        <br>
                        I lack motivation to get up, which is why I sleep in until 5PM on weekends.
                        <br>
                        I binge drink when I get the chance to.
                        <br>
                        I enjoy spending time alone so I don't rub off on other people.
                        <br>
                        I try not to perpetuate negativity but do so anyways.
                        <br>
                        I have no special person to say good night to.
                        <br><br>

                        Maybe I spend so much time trying to figure out what I'm sad about, that I dig myself a deeper hole by finding flaws in myself, the world, and others; all the while forgetting the beauty and goodness that exists.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Happiness</h2>

                    <blockquote>You can't be happy if you don't want or let yourself be happy. Likewise you can't love others when you can't love yourself.</blockquote>

                    <p>This is something I tell a lot of people that talk to me when they vent about a rut they're in, a relationship problem that they're trying to solve, a career obstacle they've encountered, or anything that will fade their smiles.</p>

                    <p>My version of pursuing happiness is being able to look forward to something positive, something that gets you going through your day, your week, your month, your year, and quite possibly your life. </p>

                    <p>This may explain why a lot of people try to find fulfillment in a variety of different things. Setting new goals, always wanting more, and ultimately never being content.</p>

                    <p>Well so what? What's the point of this blog post? There is no point, I don't know what the point of it is either. It's what I'm trying to figure out. I just want to do my best to sort out all the emotions that run through my head.</p>
